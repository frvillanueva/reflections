What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it creates a hidden directory for git,
within the current working directory. You need to do this in order to
create the version control system for that particular directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the
repository in that it lets you prepare which files need to be added to
the commit; it allows you to make revisions to the commit before you
finalize it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

After you make changes to the file in question, you can use git diff to
compare changes made between the working directory and the staging
area, then use git diff --stagedd to compare the staging area to the
most recent commit. In both commands, you can compare what has been
changed and what has not, before actually committing the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized is when you want to make an experimental addition or
restructuring to your file or program, while keeping a working version.
One example we went through is testing out an easy mode, or having a
version in a different language. Branches would help by differentiating
and making clear what the different versions are.
