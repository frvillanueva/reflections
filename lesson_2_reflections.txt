What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it creates a hidden directory for git,
within the current working directory. You need to do this in order to
create the version control system for that particular directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in that it lets you prepare which files need to be added to the commit; it allows you to make revisions to the commit before you finalize it.
